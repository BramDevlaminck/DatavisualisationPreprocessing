# Datavisualisation Crime data

This repository contains some python files to extract the number of official registered bike sheds in Ghent per quarter.

Furthermore, we also created a JSON with all the University and graduate campuses that we found in Ghent.
We also include a script to add the geo point data and quarter data to these addresses.
